Abstract of the paper titled "Diverse Mathematical Formulations of Friedmann’s Equations for Explaining Expansion
of Big Bang Universe in the Presence and Absence of Dark Energy":

In cosmological theory, one of the most crucial principles is the ongoing, dynamic expansion of the universe, a concept substantiated
by early 20th-century astronomical observations such as Edwin Hubble’s redshift measurements of remote galaxies. Emerging
from Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, the Friedmann equations—conceived in 1920—constitute a mathematical
framework governing cosmic evolution. These equations are derived from the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
metric, which presupposes a universe that is isotropic and homogeneous at macroscopic scales. The Friedmann equations consist
of two distinct differential equations that factor in the spatial distribution of matter-energy constituents within the cosmos, thereby
shaping its expansive behavior over time. This review paper delves into the intricate variations of Friedmann’s equations, elucidating
the underpinnings of cosmic expansion, while also probing the enigmatic role of dark matter in this expansive framework.
